## **Project Overview**

The RSVP Task Manager is a Python-based task management system developed in Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to efficiently **add, view, update, and delete tasks**. Each task includes key attributes such as:

- Task Name  
- Category (e.g., Academics, Personal)  
- Deadline  
- Status (Pending / Done)  
- Task Urgency (Low / Medium / High)  
- Task Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)  

This project demonstrates the application of **problem-solving concepts** and **Python programming skills** to a real-world scenario of task management.

## **Features**

1. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks with all attributes.  
2. **View Tasks:** Displays all tasks in a tabular format.  
3. **Update Status:** Allows changing the status of a task (Pending → Done).  
4. **Delete Task:** Removes tasks from the system using Task ID.  
5. **Interactive Menu:** Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.  
6. **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved in a CSV file (`tasks.csv`) and persist across sessions.

## **Project Evolution**

- **Initial Version:** Tasks included only `Task Name`, `Urgency`, and `Difficulty`.  
- **Final Version:** Expanded to include `Category`, `Deadline`, and `Status`, allowing better task organization and prioritization.
